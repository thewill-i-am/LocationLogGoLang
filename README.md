This repository contains a backend project written in Golang that performs operations on a database and Firebase. The project is responsible for real-time logging of the location of students. The backend interacts with the database to store and retrieve location data and uses Firebase for authentication and real-time updates. The codebase is written in Golang, and follows a clean architecture design pattern. This repository is intended to serve as a reference point for anyone looking to build a backend in Golang, and also as a proof of concept for real-time location logging using Firebase.
